    "### Bidirectional Breadth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, bidirectional BFS is a variation of BFS. It consists of two BFS with different directions. One BFS starts from the beginning vertex and the other BFS starts from the ending vertex. BFS of both ends expand their own search trees until two trees get connected by one vertex (potentially more than one). The concept is similar to Borůvka’s algorithm. When two connected components form a bigger one, the algorithm stops and returns a result. Bidirectional BFS outperforms a conventional BFS in time complexity. Since two graph traversal happens at the same time, it can hypothetically cut the required time in half. In the worst case, it is as bad as a traditional BFS. However, there is always a tradeoff. Bidirectional BFS requires two more conditions which BFS does not. One, there is an extra parameter, an ending vertex. Two, the underlying graph has to be undirected, otherwise the intersection does not guarantee a connecting path.\n",
